# 1D-Harmonic-Oscillator-Schr-dinger-Equation-Solver-Python-
This project was completed during my undergraduate studies in 2024 for the Atom Physics course, with the assistance of Professor Jian Li，when I was a sophomore in college.

During the first half of the 2024 academic year, I completed a project in my Atomic Physics course where I solved the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Schrödinger equation using the finite difference method. I then presented my findings to the class. 

This project deliverables included the presentation slides, as well as the source codes I wrote. These codes not only solve the quantum mechanical equations for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator but also addresse the one-dimensional motion within an infinitely high potential well and the quantum mechanical equations for the hydrogen atom.
